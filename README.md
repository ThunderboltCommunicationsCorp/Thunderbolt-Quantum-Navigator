# Thunderbolt Quantum Navigator
A lightweight browser made to provide functionality!

# We're Delaying the Move!

Due to technical issues with the development of the UWP version of the browser, the win32 version is going back online and is going to be receiving more featuyre updates until we have faced ther problem with the UWP counterpart!

Thank you for sticking with us at this time of the development stages!
